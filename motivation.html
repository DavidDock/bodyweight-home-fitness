            <h2>Advice to Begginers from Arnold Schwarzenegger</h2>
            <p>My advice to beginners is really simple: begin. And then don’t stop until it is a routine.</p>
            <p>For a lot of people, that first step is the hardest. So find something, anything, you can do.
                 If you have been completely sedentary, go on a 30 minute walk. If you walk all the time and
                 you have never done any strength training, you don’t need equipment: do 5 pushups, then do 5 squats.
                 If your heart’s beating fast, rest for a minute. Now do 4 pushups, and 4 squats. Rest if you need to.
                 Then do 3 pushups and 3 squats. Then 2 and 2, then 1 and 1. You just did 15 pushups and 15 squats.
                 If it was easy, start at 10 next time.
            </p>
            <p>Once you begin, the key is keeping your momentum. That’s why I encourage everyone to set goals they can
                 achieve when they’re just starting out. Train 10 minutes every day for a month. Then make it 15 minutes.
                 Motivation is fleeting, but routine is what carries you on. You need to make this a routine. Do whatever
                 you can do every day for a month, and then build on that.
            </p>
