            <h3> Additional information about exercise guides</h3>
            <p>The exercise examples are designed for everyone to do at home with no special equipment... other than a
                chair, a table or a box.</p>
            <p>We have included pull-ups and chin-ups as they are an excellent all round exercise. If you don't have a
                pull-up bar
                you can always do Australian pull-ups instead using a table.
