        <h2> About our Workout Examples</h2>
        <p>Here are a few examples of fun workouts that can be done at home.</p>
        <p>Remember what was said in the <a href="motivation.html" aria-label="About the website with motivational articles and quotes">motivational articles</a>. 
            Any amount of exercise is better than none. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do want to complete the whole workout great..... but really they are there as a guide and you can do as little
            or as much as your time allows. Maybe even split the workout in little pieces throughout the day.

        <h3>Murph</h3>

        <p>
            This is a big workout designed by <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Takes you to CrossFit.com (opens in a new  tab)">CrossFit</a>. It includes
            some running so if you are able to get out and go for a run, great, but if not just modify the workout and drop the runs.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start with a 1 mile run.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do 100 Pull-ups (or modify to Australian Pull-ups if preferred).
            </li>
            <li>
                Do 200 Push-ups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do 300 Squats.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish with another 1 mile run.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If completed in one go this can take a very long time. Feel free to modify this workout, maybe split
            the Pull-ups, Push-ups and Squats into smaller sections to do throughout the day.
