        <h2> About Our Workout Examples</h2>
        <p>Here are a few examples of fun workouts that can be done at home.</p>
        <p>Remember what was said in the <a href="motivation.html"
                aria-label="About the website with motivational articles and quotes">motivational articles</a>.
            Any amount of exercise is better than none.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do want to complete the whole workout great..... but really they are there as a guide and you can do
            as little
            or as much as your time allows. Maybe even split the workout in little pieces throughout the day.

        <h3>Every Minute On The Minute</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Pick an <a href="exercises.html" aria-label="Takes you to the exercise examples page">exercise</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a timer for 1 minute and perform 8-12 repetitions of the exercise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the repetitions are complete rest for the remainder of the minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the timer again, do the prescribed number of repetitions, and rest the remainder of the minute.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can try and complete as many rounds as you like or as time allows but for a begginer aim for 5-6 rounds.
            If you are more advanced aim for 10-12 rounds.
        </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Do 1 minute of Pull-ups (or modify to Australian Pull-ups if preferred).

            <li>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This is an intense 5 minute workout. You can do as many rounds of this you like resting inbetween
            or even do it several times throughout the day when you have a little free time.

        <h3>Murph</h3>

        <p>
            This is a big workout designed by <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                aria-label="Takes you to CrossFit.com (opens in a new tab)">CrossFit</a>. It includes
            some running, so if you are able to get out and go for a run that's great, but if not just modify the
            workout and drop the runs.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start with a 1 mile run.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do 100 Pull-ups (or modify to Australian Pull-ups if preferred).
            </li>
            <li>
                Do 200 Push-ups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do 300 Squats.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish with another 1 mile run.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If completed in one go this can take a very long time. Feel free to modify this workout, maybe split
            the Pull-ups, Push-ups and Squats into smaller sections to do throughout the day.
        </p>

        <h3>The Doubler</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Pick 1 lower body <a href="exercises.html"
                    aria-label="Takes you to the exercise examples page">exercise</a>
                and 1 upper body <a href="exercises.html"
                    aria-label="Takes you to the exercise examples page">exercise</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do as many repetitions as you can of the 1st exercise, then as many as you can of the 2nd.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rest for 30-60 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat above 2 steps for 5 rounds.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Remember that some exercise is better than none so if time doesn't allow for 5 rounds in one go just do what
            you can, when you can.
        </p>

        <h3>Deck Of Cards</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Get a pack of cards and allocate an <a href="exercises.html"
                    aria-label="Takes you to the exercise examples page">exercise</a> to each suit.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shuffle pack and turn over top card. Complete that number repetitions of the corresponding exercise. Ace
                is 1 repetion and any of the picture cards are 12 repetions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Work you way through the whole pack.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This workout is good funand totals 354 repetitions if you complete the pack. Again this is something you can
            spread out through the day.
