            <p>Here are a few examples of fun workouts that can be done at home.</p><br>
            <p>Remember what was said in the <a href="motivation.html"
                    aria-label="About the website with motivational articles and quotes">motivational articles</a>.
                Any amount of exercise is better than none.

            <p>
                If you do want to complete the whole workout great..... but really they are there as a guide and you can
                do
                as little
                or as much as your time allows. Maybe even split the workout in little pieces throughout the day.

                    Once the repetitions are complete rest for the remainder of the minute.

                <li>
                    Start the timer again, do the prescribed number of repetitions, and rest the remainder of the

            <p>
                This is a big workout designed by <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    aria-label="Takes you to CrossFit.com (opens in a new tab)">CrossFit</a>. It includes
                some running, so if you are able to get out and go for a run that's great, but if not just modify the
                workout and drop the runs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Start with a 1 mile run.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do 100 Pull-ups (or modify to Australian Pull-ups if preferred).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do 200 Push-ups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do 300 Squats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finish with another 1 mile run.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                If completed in one go this can take a very long time. Feel free to modify this workout, maybe split
                the Pull-ups, Push-ups and Squats into smaller sections to do throughout the day.

                <li>
                    Do as many repetitions as you can of the 1st exercise, then as many as you can of the 2nd.

                <li>
                    Rest for 30-60 seconds.

            <br>
            <p>
                Remember that some exercise is better than none so if time doesn't allow for 5 rounds in one go just do
                what
                you can, when you can.

                    is 1 repetition and any of the picture cards are 12 repetitions.
