        <h2> About our Workout Examples</h2>
        <p>Here are a few examples of fun workouts that can be done at home.</p>
        <p>Remember what was said in the <a href="motivation.html" aria-label="About the website with motivational articles and quotes">motivational articles</a>. 
            Any amount of exercise is better than none. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do want to complete the whole workout great..... but really they are there as a guide and you can do as little
            or as much as your time allows. Maybe even split the workout in little pieces throughout the day.

        <h3>Every Minute On The Minute</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pick an <a href="exercises.html" aria-label="Takes you to the exercise examples page">exercise</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a timer for 1 minute and perform 8-12 repetitions of the exercise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the repetitions are complete rest for the remainder of the minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the timer again, do the prescribed number of repetitions, and rest the remainder of the minute.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can try and complete as many rounds as you like or as time allows but for a begginer aim for 5-6 rounds.
            If you are more advanced aim for 10-12 rounds.
