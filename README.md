## **UX**

### Whos the site for?
* This site is primarily for people who struggle making time for exercise. 
* For people with a range of exercise experience but one of the main goals of the site is to make sure its accessible for begginers.
* For people looking to workout at home with no gym equipment using just your own body.

### Considerations for the culture of audience
This site is to be accessible to a wide audience looking for motivation but also for begginers. This means that both the design and content must not be overwhelming. The site structure is simple and easy to navigate with an inviting design.
One of the main messages in this website is that any amount of exercise is better than none so big complex workout and exercise examples are not needed, so again simple minimal content is used throughout the site.

## **Imagery** ##

The images where carefully chosesn to match the breif of the website, they are not overwhelming yet distinctive. The images in the 'home page' and 'contact response page' are subtle in colour but are in keeping with the culture of the audience. The exercise example images are agian simple but easy to digest. 

## **Wireframes**

Wireframes were made with Balsamiq for Mobile, Tablet and Laptop devices.

## **Color Scheme and Typography**

In keeping with my considerations for the culture of my audience I looked for a color scheme that would be simple but not dull and something that would not overwhelm. I found my color scheme on [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/). 
To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](http://www.eightshapes.com) to generate an accessibility table.

I again wanted to use simple yet exiting typography which is easy to read. I found my fonts on [sliderrevolution.com](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/design/font-combinations/).

# **Features**

## **Header and Nav bar**

![Header](assets/media/mobile-tablet-header.jpg)
![Header](assets/media/desktop-header.jpg)<br>

* The title of Bodyweight Home Fitness is clear, simple and stylish. It is responsive to all devices and  it acts as a link to the 'home page'. It has a subtle blinking boarder to gain attention.

* The Nav bar is present on all pages of the website and is very clear to see allowing for easy navigation. The active page is highlighted and a hover effect is also used to enhance ux. 

## **Footer**

![Footer](assets/media/footer.jpg)<br>

* The footer is large, visible and responsive to all devices. I have included a hover toggle to the links to improve UX. These icons were imported from font awesome using Javascript at the bottom of the page.

## **Anchor tags**

 * I wanted to keep the tags in keeping with the websites minimal style but visible for users so the default style was removed and the link is highlighed by bold font. The only exeption to this was in the 'contact response page' where the social medial links needed an underline text decoration to help with highlighting the link.
 * External links are provided throughout the website for every article and workout example, opening in new tabs and with aria-lables. I have also included internal links to help with simple navigation.

 ## **Home Page**

 ![Home Page](assets/media/home.png)<br>

 * I opted for a subtle but stylish home page so not to overwhelm and provide intriuge for the user, with a artistic image and 3 motivaional quotes. 
 * With the easy to access nav bar it helps the user quickly click onto a subject they are inertested in and provide a great start to the websites journey.

 ## **Motivation Page**

 ![Motivation Page](assets/media/motivation.png)<br>

* The motivation page has a section that states the goals for the webisite, hoping to motivate and help continue the users fitness journey.<br>
* There are three short articles to read. They were chosen because they are consise, motivational and intended for a wide audience.<br>
* These articles are broken up by motivatonal quotes to inspire the user.<br>
* Initially I intended to add background images to the quotes but it did not work stylistically.<br>
* Each article has a link to the source and each quote has  it's source named.<br>
* CSS grid was used to change layout at 600px breakpoint to ensure good UX.

## **Workouts Page**

![Workouts Page](assets/media/workouts.png)<br>

* The workout page has an introduction to encourage users and 5 workout examples.<br>

* Links to other helpful sites are provided for users to continue thier fitness journey.<br>
* This page is fully responsive and changes css layout using flex at 768px devices. Initially I felt 1024px would be the breakpoint, but after inital viewing this had to be changed.


## **Exercise Page**

![Exercises Page](assets/media/exercises.png)<br>

* This exercise example page has an introduction  and images of how to do 18 home exercise.<br>
* In keeping with the websites goal, these exercise guides are as accessible and simple as can be with straight-forward images on how to complete each exercise so not to overwhelm. These images have a detailed 'alt' description for people who use screen readers.<br>
* This exercise image gallery is fully responsive, changing layout at different screen breakpoints to ensure good UX. 

## **Contact Page**

![Contact Page](assets/media/contact.png)<br>

* Straight forward contact form with an introductory message asking for workout examples or just a general message.
* A 'get' method was used instead of 'post' in order to get a simulated contact response when the form is subbmitted.

## **Contact Response Page**

![Contact Response Page](assets/media/contact-response.png)<br>

* This page provides a thank you message to users who submit the contact form.
* There are two images under the thank you message which match the style and message of the website.

# **Future Enhancements**
* To add more exercises to exercise page.
* To add more workouts to workouts page. It would be great to put in users workpouts and user stories on how they motivate themselves. 
* If more content is added I would add in different images and quotes to break up the text sections to enhance user experience.
