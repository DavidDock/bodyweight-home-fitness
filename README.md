## **UX**

### Whos the site for?
* This site is primarily for people who struggle making time for exercise.

### Considerations for the culture of audience
This site is to be accessible to a wide audience looking for motivation but also for begginers. This means that both the design and content must not be overwhelming. The site structure is simple and easy to navigate with an inviting design.
One of the main messages in this website is that any amount of exercise is better than none so big complex workout and exercise examples are not needed, so again simple minimal content is used throughout the site.

## **Color Scheme and Typography**

In keeping with my considerations for the culture of my audience I looked for a color scheme that would be simple but not dull and something that would not overwhelm. I found my color scheme on [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/). 
To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](http://www.eightshapes.com) to generate an accessibility table.

I again wanted to use simple yet exiting typography which is easy to read. I found my fonts on [sliderrevolution.com](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/design/font-combinations/).
