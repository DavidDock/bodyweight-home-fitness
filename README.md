## UX

### Whos the site for?
This site is primarily for people who struggle making time for exercise. Its for people with a range of exercise experience but one of the main goals of the site is to make sure its accessible for begginers.

### Considerations for the culture of audience
This site is meant to be accessible to a wide audience looking for motivation and also for begginers to fitness. This means that both the design and content is not too overwhelming. The site structure is simple and easy to navigate with an inviting design.
One of the main messages in this website is that any amount of exercise is better than none so big complex workout and exercise examples are not needed so again simple minimal content is used throughout the site.
