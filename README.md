## **Color Scheme and Typography**

In fitting in with my considerations for the culture of my audience I looked for a color scheme that would be simple but not boring and something that would not overwhelm. I found my color scheme on [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/). 
To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](http://www.eightshapes.com) to generate an accessibility table.
